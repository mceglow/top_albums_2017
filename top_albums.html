				Marek's Top 15 Albums 2017

			<div class="album_box">
				Hello there dear reader! This is my 3rd annual "top albums of the year" list. Until this point, I've sort of just named off the albums I enjoyed most, but this year I decided to spice it up with a stylized webpage.
				<br><br>
				I hope you enjoy this list and little window into my music tastes. Maybe you'll find something you like. All of the albums below have been released this year.

					</div>
					<div class="description">
						This (mostly) solo-piano album has been wonderful for starting my mornings off. My routine when I come into work often includes picking out the "first album I'll hear today", and this one has been such a great go-to choice.
						<br><br>
						The compositions are minimal, using layers and space to create gorgeous textures and moods. It sets up a sentimental tone without being overwhelming or too grabbing of attention. It makes those mornings warm and beautiful as I settle into the code-writing mindset.
						<br><br>
						A few songs use these private answering-machine messages that Duval's friends left for him. It's neat to think about what the context behind them could be. They add a nice personal touch to the album.

						This album immediately creates beautiful atmospheres and deep moods for me. Ambient artists these days seem to often resort to being overwhelming or minimal to get that emotional space, but Björn Meyer does it very effectively without that. It's incredible what he does with just his bass.
						<br><br>
						I very frequently listen to this one on late-night rides home. I pick it a lot since it's easy listening for me, but still accompanied with really pleasant feelings.

						<div class="tags">Tags: Experimental Jazz, Ambient, Noise</div>

					</div>
					<div class="description">
						From Toronto, Joseph Shabason uses instruments you may hear in a jazz setting to create reflective, ethereal moods. The spaces he creates feel very internal for me (as opposted to atmospheric). You could probably picture expansive environments with the music, but personally I find this album really draws me inward. The focus becomes emotion, mood, feeling, thoughts.
						<br><br>
						His choices in writing/production are just so fantastic. Even though I know I'm listening to a sax or drums or whatever, the way they are played, and the way the effects enhance them, give them totally different aesthetics. The songs each share a deep, mystical tone, but manage to vary across different worlds of emotion.
						<br><br>
						I usually end up listening to this while I draw or on late-night drives home. Something to note though for a potential listener is that the songs "Smokestack" and "Belching Smoke" use feedback and a free-jazz style that's a sort of abrasive. You may prefer to skip those songs, but the rest are quite calming.

					<div class="description">
						This is crushing, overwhelming drone done right. Rafael Anton Irisarri's <a href="https://irisarri.bandcamp.com/album/a-fragile-geography">A Fragile Geography</a> was one of my favorite drone records in 2015. Gorgeous, sad textures with some really outstanding mastering. This album is yet another step up.
						<br><br>
						The music just explodes out and hits you full force with images of apocalyptic devastation. Mountains and skyscrapers are tumbling, grey skies are swirling menacingly, roaring seas are smashing into jagged cliffs. If you can just sit and commit to letting the music reeeally sink into you, the raw emotional power of this album is phenomenal.
						<br><br>
						It can take a lot of energy to listen to this all the way through, so I don't do it too often. But when I do, I usually end up pausing what I'm doing to marvel at the beauty this album presents. This tends to inspire a lot of reflective thinking.

						<div class="tags">Tags: Experimental Hip-hop, Art-Rap, Ambient</div>

					</div>
					<div class="description">
						Rap is a genre I've never really been that into growing up. I've dabbled slightly but it just never caught my ear. Then a good friend of mine introduced me to rappers like Open Mike Eagle, Busdriver, and milo. For once, I had rap music that I actually could identify with. Milo wasn't rapping about money, womanizing, drugs, partying. He was just some guy with philosophical interests and a curious outlook on life. He talked about social change and individuality. He was even slightly nerdy like me (without totally pushing that image).
						<br><br>
						Not only did his lyrics intrigue me, but the beats were experimental and interesting. He wasn't afraid to push the boundaries of what hip-hop sounds like. Sometimes he'd stop talking and just let the ambience flow. Sometimes he'd play with his voice and electronically mess with it in real time. Sometimes he'd drop in poetry readings and documentary samples. My absolute favorite work of his (<a href="https://miloraps.bandcamp.com/album/too-much-of-life-is-mood">too much of life is mood</a>) reeaaally takes that experimentation far.
						<br><br>
						In this album, he talks about being an artist, taking real steps toward it, truly living off your craft. Some feelings and thoughts he has associated with that. Among other things. For me, it's pretty fascinating stuff. I have deep respect for people who follow their passion despite existential/cultural difficulty. Surviving as an artist is a concept I wasn't even really aware of until I was out of school. I mostly just consumed art without thinking about the creators much. But now I'm learning about the everyday people that bring these things into being and it's been really inspiring. Anyway, really solid album. I really enjoyed listening to it.

						This album is perfect for an imagination adventure. If you commit to it, it elicits some fantastic imagery. Trying to describe how it sounds does it no justice. I mean, I cooould tell you there is cool ambient stuff happening with a variety of instruments. Or that the effects and field recordings are expertly used for incredible emotional responses. But I think maybe just writing down some imagery I get while listening to this might be more interesting. Note though, that hearing my experience might affect how you perceive it, so you may choose to not read until after you listen yourself. See my recount below:

							Steadily floating, you pass through the walls of an unfamiliar port town. You hear the subtle chatter of people in cafes. A lonely chef rolls a cart across the brick flooring of an alleyway. She sighs. Sitting on the dock, some children hum and sing, their feet dangling over the water. Everything feels hazy.. mystical.. distant.. 
							<br><br>
							You end up in someone's home. The walls are plain. There's not much furniture. A man is sitting on the hardwood floor, plucking away at a guitar. In the other room, the sounds of pots and pans being tapped on rhythmically. Some sort of brass horn in the distance..
							<br><br>
							You open your eyes. You're in a black box theatre. You take a seat. A lone performer walks out on stage. His words evoke countless emotions. You're entranced. Visions flash before you. Each with a unique mood. You open your eyes. You're at the town square. There's nobody around. You don't remember how you got here. You begin to wander. You hear sounds of life.. but there's nobody around. It's a.. ghost town. You sit down and place your hands in your head. Sadness overcomes you.. The world fades..
							<br><br>
							A hand on your shoulder. You look up. A stranger with a warm smile. Around you the town is bustling with energy?! Friends are laughing, children are playing, people are racing. It's a beautiful day! Your friend takes your hand and shows you around town... This adventure is not yet over...

						Hailing from Guelph, Graham Steinman produces some really wonderful ghostly sounds crossed with foot-tapping folk moods. One moment you're enjoying some great blues riffs and the next this spooky, somber territory creeps in.. You're drifting through that, unsure of where it may lead, and then you come out on the other side to a field of yellow grass. The soft sounds of a banjo and swaying voices come in to soothe you. The rest of the album relaxes you and you come out of the experience feeling peaceful and untroubled. Really nice album.

					</div>
					<div class="description">
						For a while, the R&B aesthetic was just something I could not get into. But approaching it from an experimental angle, I started to find myself drawn to albums more with R&B influences.
						<br><br>
						I didn't quuiiiite like this album on first listen, but it caught my ear enough to save it for later. I came across it again and the second time it really hooked me in. The vocals are fun to sing along to, and the laid-back instrumentals are great for doing some smooooth dancing around the house. At my peak, I listened to this album a few times a week. Today I still throw it on once in a blue moon when I want to just give no fucks and feel hazy and suave.
						<br><br>
						Not every song is a hit for me, but the ones that are, are soo good. It's kind of an odd album, I don't quite agree with it lyrically, but sometimes I just want to sing along to some weird pop stuff like this. My top 3 favorites are: "Every Single Thing", "TV Volume", "Call Me Up".

						I *cannot* stop myself from moving to this. Minimal funk/disco grooves that just hit HARD. This album isn't going to impress you with complexity. It's not going to take you to another world. It's not gonna squeeze it's way into your soul and rip those emotions out. But DAMN does it feel great to dance along to this. It's just so crisp.. so catchy! It usually goes something like:
						<br><br>
						I turn it on. Turn it up. Hold on.. what's this sound? Is this just setup or.. wait. wait.. WAIT. My foot. It's tapping..? My other foot just joined.. My.. shoulders are grooving along? My head is bouncing?! Uh oh... what's this? It's hooked me in! It's infected me with good mood! I'm.. I'm... dancing!!! Waaooo!
						<br><br>
						This album is simply fun. Well, mainly those first 4 tracks. Pop it on in the background of whatever you are doing and enhance your day with these grooves!

						Listening to The Fun Years' music over the past few years has been truly magical. Letting myself slip into their murky headspace has provided so much fulfilment. Especially on those slow, moody days where things normally would just seem to drag along. Their music fills me with awe and appreciation.
						<br><br>
						I used to listen to them a lot while walking to work in the winter. I'd be trudging along through the snow, bundled up, with my earbuds tucked underneath my jacket. The repetitive, evolving textures changed an unpleasant experience into one of beauty and emotion. Perception of my surroundings became blurry, evocative, nostalgic. It was such a cool feeling, they were my most listened-to band for a long time. I often would use their music to accompany studying and drives around town. Today their atmospheres tag along at work or when I do art things.
						<br><br>
						The music itself is by Ben Recht on baritone guitar and Isaac Sparks on turntable. Together they produce swirling loops of magnificence. Focused yet fluid, gloomy yet comfortable, crackly yet smooth. This album in particular includes more uplifting themes. It's more optimistic and maybe even more evoking of nostalgic feelings than usual. It isn't my favorite album of theirs, but it's still really wonderful and I listened to it quite a bit this year.
						<br><br>
						My all-time favorites of theirs are: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBgC6AYONNs">Baby, It's Cold Inside</a> and <a href="https://mega.nz/#!jsB11AjA!W9-lF4aUgTsSAb4VO0nsi69PIsQdCbHQ5KfKHEAtbTQ">God Was Like, No</a>.

						This is such a gorgeous album! For over a month, it only had 2 preview tracks that I listened to over and over. I had no idea who this August Rosenbaum guy was, but those songs built up some pretty high expectations for the rest of the album. When it finally came out, it did <i>not</i> disappoint. The sounds.. the production.. the moods.. It's just so damn good.
						<br><br>
						It's definitely a sensational experience letting yourself be in the moment with these compelling sounds coming in from every angle. There's a beautifully diverse mix of organic vs synthetic without breaking overall cohesion. Somehow he's drawn in influences from jazz, soul, R&B, classical, trip-hop, electronic, ambient, et cetera without making it feel like some sort of jumbled compilation. I'm thoroughly impressed whenever I listen to this. Truly a great album.

						What a spectacular entry into that soulful sound. This album surprised me cause I haven't really enjoyed music like it before. Yet, I've been singing and "rockin' out" to this album in the car sooo much this year. The melodies ricochet beautifully over those wonky, spacious rhythms. The feel is just reaaal daamnn cooool. I find it just insanely fun to move to. I don't understand why it's a less popular album of his, it's my absolute favorite one. It's always such a good choice for singing along to in the car. Aside from that I don't have much more to say, it's basically just an album I've thoroughly enjoyed listening to!

						Immediately, my head starts bobbing up and down. I'm tapping my feet. I'm leaning left, right, left right. I can't keep my hands still. The drums have taken over my body. The keys pull on my soul. The trumpet sings me into the sky. The guitar gives me a sly look. The sax puts shades on. The bass bobs its head to the music.
						<br><br>
						Antifon came out in March, and since that point, I've expanded what I like to listen to. But this album has been a big influence on where and what I've been exploring. It feels like so much has happened since I discovered it, yet when I come back to it, I'm still impressed. It's really a defining experimental jazz album that's inspiring a lot of modern UK jazz right now. I feel so cool every time I hear it. Perfect for feeling like badass on my way to whatever thing I'm going to.

						This album is so sad. Phil Elverum wrote these songs in response to his wife's death from cancer. It's sobering to listen to, and it's likely to make you cry. But oddly enough, it feels healing. Underneath the gloomy exterior is something raw and beautiful. I've listened to this in a sad state and somehow felt stronger afterward. The writing/production on this is great, he's a very skilled musician. But the real power of this album is in the heartbreaking lyrics. Seriously, they just cut into you deep and truly move you. Give it a chance if you like sad music.

						I stumbled upon this album and immediately it became my go-to autumn-feels album. The winds were blowing, the leaves were falling, and people were walking around in light jackets. This album just felt perfect. Somehow, I'm never not in the mood to listen to this. As soon as it starts I'm glad to have picked it. I play it in the morning to start my day off in a good mood. I play it after work to make traffic a nicer experience. I play it at home to accompany doing chores. It was sort of a ritual for a while.
						<br><br>
						It's not as grandiose as some other choices on here. It is bedroom pop after all. But I think it deserves first for me because its been consistently accessible ever since I discovered it. I just really enjoy how these songs are constructed, the mood behind them, and the choices they made. I just enjoy every part of this album. It's a light listen, but its graceful and satisfying and I know I'm going to keep coming back to hear it again and again.
